      A web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of
      the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their
      Akan Name.

    <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.</p>
    <p>
      Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name'
      which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
