    <h1>About Akan Calculator</h1>
    <p>
      A web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of
      the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their
      Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in
      Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which
      corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
